## Get Data

Rami Krispin created a R package to get worldwide data on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV-2) epidemic.  Details are available here: https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/index.html.   
There are two versions available. The data from the CRAN version, which can be installed by:  
```
install.package("coronavirus")
```
is not updated daily.  
For data which is updated daily, use the Github version by executing this:

```
#Must have "devtools" installed for the github version.
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/coronavirus")
```
Note: When executing this RMarkdown code, I am not actually running the two lines above.  I found that they don't work properly in RMarkdown.  I execute in R on my desktop (using IDE R Studio) to get library(coronavirus) data updated with the most recent data.  Most recent data seems to be data from the previous day, i.e. it doesn't have current day's data [that i can tell].

Look at the data:
```{r}
# Use the coronavirus package.
library(coronavirus)
# Get the first six rows.
head(coronavirus)
# Get the last six rows.
tail(coronavirus)
```

Let's find some details like:  
- Types of "type"  
- Earliest date entry  
- Latest date entry  




``` {r include=FALSE}
# use Tidyverse packages.
library(tidyverse)
```

```
# Use Tidyverse packages.
library(tidyverse)
```

``` {r}
# Make data as a tibble.
coronavirus <- as_tibble(coronavirus)
# Take a look at data.
coronavirus

# Group by Region and type.
# Summarize by cases.
# Order from large to small.
# See 20 largest data entries.
# Date in package was changed.  "Country.Region" changed to "country".
corona_summary <- coronavirus %>% group_by(country, type) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(-total_cases)
corona_summary %>% head(20)
# Get latest and earliest dates.
max(coronavirus$date)
min(coronavirus$date)

# Get new confirmed cases and deaths for the most recent date.
# Get most recent date.
# Use Region, type, cases.
# Extract different "types" into columns.
# Largest value of "confirmed" on top.
coronavirus %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) %>%
  select(country = country, type, cases) %>%
  group_by(country, type) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = total_cases) %>%
  arrange(-confirmed)
```

corona virusThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
